Started with the file directory, also created a .js since I going to be using a menu with some js function that have used earlier for some private projects.
I added some metadata to the documents and linked them together. A favicon, or a "tab image", was added that I got from favicon.com. Even some description, keywords and author was added. The rest was already in the code institute template.
Added the hero video loop to the main page added som styling to cover the whole screen. The video is from pexels.com
I tested the video in chrome dev tools and and made changes to the sizing since it got distorted on mobile device. Changed width from 100vw to 100% and deleted the hight propery.
Added the videos to page-2 "the video page" embedded from youtube. The video playlist comes from GMBN (Global Mountain Bike Network) and their "How To in 60 sec" series. I created seperate div element for each video and added the video title. I warpped the iframes in divs so that I easier can make them more responsive and use positioning or flexbox.
