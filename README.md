# Love Riding

Love Riding is a video tuorial on how to do some basic mountainbiking skills
broken down in 60 second videos. It's a great resource to turn to when it's  time to ride that steep drop of you been avoiding, tackle an obstacle you been strugling with or if you just wan't to improve your skills in general whether your a beginner or an experienced rider. 

The simple format of one minute how-to's with a very consice step-by-step breakdown is genius because it prevent information overload and over thinkinig wich is probably the most common reason for bailing out when trying to do a difficult section of a trail, or even worse, wipe out.
