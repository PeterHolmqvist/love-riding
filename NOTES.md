Started with the file directory, also created a .js since I going to be using a menu with some js function that have used earlier for some private projects.
I added some metadata to the documents and linked them together. A favicon, or a "tab image", was added that I got from favicon.com. Even some description, keywords and author was added. The rest was already in the code institute template.
Added the hero video loop to the main page added som styling to cover the whole screen. The video is from pexels.com
I tested the video in chrome dev tools and and made changes to the sizing since it got distorted on mobile device. Changed width from 100vw to 100% and deleted the hight propery.
Added the videos to page-2 "the video page" embedded from youtube. The video playlist comes from GMBN (Global Mountain Bike Network) and their "How To in 60 sec" series. I created seperate div element for each video and added the video title. I warpped the iframes in divs so that I easier can make them more responsive and use positioning or flexbox. 
added navbar from w3schools.com
some fonts added from google fonts and some styling to the navbar. 
added some article text to the main page some transparent background.
added image to video section of the page from, pexels.com shout out Danny Bor.

After testing I decided to ditch the 3 separate pages and go with one page design. This due to the load time i experienced testing on mobile phone. And also that the navigtion menu was to cluttered with 3 pages plus 10 video sections. 

Did some testing in google dev tool and adjusted header positioning accordingly. Added contact page and some map and a footer.

tossed out the map and the footer I was borrowing from coders coffehouse and started over from scratch, could not get the positioning with the iframe element.
